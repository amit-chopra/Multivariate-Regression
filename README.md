# Project Name
> **Boom Bike Demand Prediction with Multivariate Regression**


## Table of Contents
* [General Info] Model the demand for shared bikes with provided independent variables. Model will help management understand key drivers for the demand 
* [Technologies Used]Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, Matplot Lib
* [Conclusions]Temperature is the most important feature in determining the demand for Boom Bikes. Other important observations are as follows:

•	There is higher demand for Boom bikes during summer and fall, with the lowest demand in spring.
•	The demand for boom bikes is trending higher year of year 
•	Not surprisingly, the demand for boom bikes is highest in summer and fall months (from May through October)
•	There is more demand for Boom Bikes on regular days with greater dispersion is observed for holidays
•	No trend can be observed from the day of the week
•	Better weather conditions, clear weather days have the highest demand for Boom Bikes
